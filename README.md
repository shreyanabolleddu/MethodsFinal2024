Background
Our project incorporates cognitive neuroscience with quantitative analysis, specifically looking at how neural activity, measured through EEG signals, correlates with a working memory task, which in our case is a motor imagery classification. Motor imagery is a class of event-related potentials; it is the action of imagining a task without doing any actual movements.

Project Description 
We are interested in looking at the 5 distinct powerbands (brainwaves) from 4 input sensors for all individuals. Using this data, we will complete thorough statistical analysis to observe changes of neural activity per task and explore individual variability when collecting this type of data. We also plan to use Fourier analysis to try to cluster changes in brainwaves and compare to the marked data.

Dataset
The dataset found here is from a motor imagery classification project, where the cohort imagines holding a cup with either left or right hand, and a relaxed state. The goal of this project was to translate Muse2 wearable brainwave time series data into a motor imagery classification model. This data was collected from 19 healthy individuals (12 males, 7 females) aged between 19 and 68 across the United States.
